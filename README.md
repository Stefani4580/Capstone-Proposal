# Wireframe of your application
These wireframes don't have to be production grade wireframes or hi-fidelity
They have to be a general guide as to how the components would be created and used once your project is created
Should have a wireframe for every page you will create for your application
NOTE: Page and components could be different. You don't need a wireframe for every component. Although it wouldn't hurt to have a description of how every component would look

What each library helps accomplish/make easier. Or what problem they solve.
